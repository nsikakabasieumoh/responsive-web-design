                <h2>Highlights</h2>

                <ol>
                    <li><p>In 2013, Peterson registered a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JordanBPeterson">YouTube channel</a> 
                        and immediately began uploading recordings of lectures and interviews.</p></li>
                    
                    <li><p>On 27 September 2016, Peterson announced his objection to the Canadian government's Bill C-16, 
                        which proposed to add "gender identity or expression" as a prohibited ground of discrimination under the Canadian Human Rights Act, 
                        and to similarly expand the definitions of promoting genocide and publicly inciting hatred in the hate speech laws in Canada.</p></li>
                    
                    <li><p>In May 2017, Peterson began The Psychological Significance of the Biblical Stories,
                        a series of live theatre lectures, also published as podcasts, 
                        in which he analyzes archetypal narratives in the Book of Genesis as patterns of behaviour ostensibly vital for personal, 
                        social and cultural stability.</p></li>
                    
                    <li><p>In 2018, Kelefa Sanneh wrote in The New Yorker that Peterson "is now one of the most influential—and polarizing—public intellectuals in 
                        the English-speaking world".</p></li>
                    
                    <li><p>In 2022, Mick Brown wrote in The Daily Telegraph that Peterson "has become the most visible, outspoken and certainly the most polarising figure in the 
                        'culture wars' between Left and Right, challenging the new orthodoxies of political correctness that have permeated academia, 
                        education, and political and cultural life."</p></li>
                    
                    <li><p>Peterson doubts the scientific consensus on climate change,saying he is "very skeptical of the models that are used to predict climate change",
                        and that "you can't trust the data because too much ideology is involved".</p></li>
